Living in Los Angeles I got to try a lot of different food. One of my favorite
dishes from Pollo Inka was the saltado dish, particularly the chicken version.
This is my recipe.

# Spicy Green Sauce
This is one of my favorite parts of this dish.

# Ingredients
- 2 Lbs (aka a bunch of) Chicken Thighs
- 2 Ripe Tomatoes
- 1 Red Onion
- 3 Garlic Gloves
- 1 Bunch Cilantro
- 3 Tbsp Soy Sauce
- 3 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar

# Steps
0. Prepare the food
1. Cook the chicken
2. Add in the garlic, onions
3. Add in the tomatoes
4. Add in the cilantro

## Start the Rice

## Start the French Fries

## Cook the chicken

## Just throw it all in

## Don't overcook the Tomatoes
Tomatoes are added at near the end just so they get softened but don't turn into
mush.

## Plate it all up

I learned and end up following this [guide](http://www.guide.com) as the basis
for this recipe. That is a great guide for the Pollo Saltado. I've also heavily
based my recipe for the green sauce from this [guide](http://www.guide.com). In
both scenarios it's most important to recognize cooking and taste will vary
from person to person. I encourage adjusting based on your own taste! You do you
boo boo.
