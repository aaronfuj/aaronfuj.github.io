For some reason, I really got interested in cutting old glass bottles into
drinking cups.
I don't know how I first learned about it.
I don't know why I enjoyed doing it.
With all of this said, I do know how to cut a glass bottle and "upcycle" it
into a drinking glass fairly well.

In this "simply complicated" guide we'll cover, from start to finish, the
different steps involved in the entire process. This can be broken down into
three sections:

- Prepwork
- The Cut
- Finishing

Furthermore, there will be a "simple" section for how to do it, and a
"complicated" section that provides more details for those wanting to learn
more.

## Tools / Materials
There are a lot of different approaches and tools available for this, such
as the [Kinkajou](https://www.bottlecutting.com), or glass cutting kits on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bottle-Cutter-Cutting-Glasses-Included/dp/B07PZ7JTKY/ref=asc_df_B07PZ7JTKY/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=343985429020&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18261913705392091385&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032812&hvtargid=aud-829758849484:pla-797949723557&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=64633019210&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=343985429020&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18261913705392091385&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032812&hvtargid=aud-829758849484:pla-797949723557). Those are all great options for someone who wants to spend money to get
a consistent cut. However, for those who are just hobbyists who want to try
something out, I'll be covering the guide using a basic glass cutter.

- Glass Cutter
- Sand Paper (80, 100, 120, 200+ grit "wet" sandpaper)
- Gloves
- A Towel
- A hot water container and pouring spout (with hot water)
- A cold water container and pouring spout (with cold water)
- (Recommended) Masking tape or Adjustable thick rubber bands

## Prepwork
### Picking the Bottle
The first thing you'll need to do is obtain some glass you want to cut. There
are definitely characteristics of glass that make it more likely to have a clean
cut and last for a longer amount of time:
- Uniform thickness (no engravings, or special symbols)
- Low amount of curvature (straight as possible)
- Stable base

SHOW SIDE-BY-SIDE EXAMPLES THAT ITERATE THE POINT WITH X vs CHECKMARKS

**Good Choices**
- Wine Bottles
- Hard Alcohol/Spirit Bottles (i.e. Whisky, Vodka)

**Bad Choices**
- Beer Bottles
- Champagne Bottles (too thick)

### Cleaning the Bottle
If your glass bottle has a label on it and you don't want to keep it or it will
get in the way of the cutting process then you should remove it before scoring
the bottle.

All labels are different, and may be different to remove. As a starting point,
warm water soaking or just rinsing and using a sponge can go a long way to get
most of the label off. If it seems to be a more sticky residue, you can also use
**WD-40** or a **Citrus Degreaser** to break down the glue for the label. If
you use a chemical solution like these, be sure to properly clean and wipe down
the bottle after the label has been removed.

> There is no magic solution to removing labels, it just comes down to scrubbing
> the bottle clean.

## The Cut
Cutting the bottle is done by _lightly_ scoring the bottle with a tool (see
the glass cutters above) following by fracturing by
**[thermally shocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_shock)** it.

1. Score the bottle **exactly** once around the bottle where you want it to be
cut. This is the **most important** step in the process for a good, clean, cut.

> If you have a tool for glass scoring which is adjustable and can be set to
> allow the bottle to be pressed flush and turned, this is great! If not, use
> an existing cup or some other **stable** surface to hold the tool and work
> with. Examples can be duct tape, other cups, and containers.

2. _(OPTIONAL)_ Add rubber bands around the scored section around a half inch
on each side of the score.
3. Prepare sink for usage by padding it with a towel.
3. Prepare two containers of water, iced and boiled.
4. Hold the bottle by the top and begin rotating the bottle slowly, pouring a
small isolated stream of hot water around the bottle for approximately 2-3
rotations
5. Continue to rotate the bottle slowly, but now switch to using a stream of
cold water.
6. Continue to repeat steps 4-5 until the bottle steps back and forth until the
bottle cleanly splits into two pieces.

> If you need to repeat steps 4 and 5 over 3x **STOP** the process. At this
> point the bottle unlikely that this will provide a clean break and it may be
> dangerous once it does break in an uneven manner.

## The Finish
At this point, hopefully you have successfully and cleanly cut the glass! _All
that's left is merely sanding it even_. If the glass was cleanly cut, this
will be relatively quick. If it was not... you may want to think twice about
whether or not you really want to keep this glass.

> Sanding takes a long time... Be patient and if it looks like you would need to
> sand down a lot of edges just take your time, or try to cut a new glass.

1. Make a bowl of water to allow for keeping the sand paper wet and get
comfortable. Depending on how polished you want your glass to be, this will take
a while.
2. Start with a low grit sandpaper, such as 80 grit. Anything lower will likely
cause chipping at the glass and be counter productive. Begin with the outside
edge of the glass, applying light pressure at approximately a 45 degree angle
and occasionally dipping your sand paper into the bowl of water as necessary.
Continue with the inside of the glass with the same angle and technique.

> Use a sanding block to aid in this process for easier sanding. Do **NOT** use
> a dremel, even at low speeds, because it is likely to cause your glass to
> chip. A random orbital sander or palm sander _can_ work well at **low** speeds
> with extra caution.

3. Next, move towards the next higher grit sand paper and repeat the process.
4. Continue incrementally moving through each grit. At around 120 grit sanding
you should have a nice "frosted" finish.
5. Continue until 2000-4000 grit to achieve a "polish" finish, and to feel like
you've really invested time into this glass... because you have.

This will be the section that breaks down how the cutting works, the differences
between techniques, and why it makes sense to follow this guide.
