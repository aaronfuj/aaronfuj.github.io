# How to upcycle glass bottles into cups

Present finished product attracting/enticing picture
- Bring in the user into the article, show the final/expected result
- Avoid boring the user up front, get straight to the steps
- A preface is nice, but it needs to be short and avoid discouragement

Identify early what is really important, what is optional, what is common knowledge, what may not be

## Prepwork
1. Remove labels, clean glass

## The Cut

1. Score the bottle (BIG NOTES AROUND KEY FACTORS OF ONCE, Side by side comparisons of good vs bad (see examples within Google/Material design guidelines)). This can have details and tips, but not too many... maybe around how to create a level score
2. (OPTIONAL) Add rubber bands around the glass to isolate water
3. Prepare sink for usage
3. Prepare two containers of water, iced and boiled
4. Rotate and pour a small isolated stream of hot water around the bottle, 2-3 rotations
5. Continue steps back and forth, if it occurs for more than twice, it is unlikely that this will provide a clean break so its time to stop and just recycle the glass

## The Finish
80, 100, 120, 200 grit sandpaper
Wet sandpaper
Simple "sand"

Detailed of how to approach sanding, why, avoiding shattering glasses, avoiding the dust inhalation

## Breaking it all down for an understanding of what to expect and why

Prepping
- All labels are different, and may be different to remove. As a starting point, warm water soaking or just rinsing and using a sponge can go a long way to get most of the label off. With sticky residue, the best options are typically going to be WD40 and Orange Citrus Degreasers. If using these options, the glass will have an oily residue on it that is beneficial to remove most of the residue to ensure a good score

Using a mechanism for leveling
- If you have a tool for glass scoring which is adjustable and can be set to allow the bottle to be pressed flushly and turned, this is great! If not, use an existing cup or some other **stable** surface to hold the tool and work with. Examples can be duct tape, other cups, containers, etc
-

Scoring can be done firmly, or lightly, as long as it really follows two core rules:
- Try to apply the same amount of pressure to the score evenly
- Only score once!!! Scoring any more will decrease the chance of a cut, let alone a clean cut.


Sanding
- Do NOT use a dremel unless at a very slow speed... it comes in too aggressive, too fast, and is likely to causing chipping. It will ultimately end up causing more chips, defects, and waste time to need to correct the issues from a dremel
- Be patient, this is a really long process and trying to use a more coarse grit will be more likely to chip, applying more pressure will likely cause it to chip, high speeds
- Ease into the angles and pressure
