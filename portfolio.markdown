Here are some projects I've worked on outside of work

## [Contest Scoreboard](https://github.com/aaronfuj/contest_scoreboard)

A real-time scoring software primarily used for skimboarding allowing for
contest organization and management.

## [Hawaii Power Ballot](http://www.hawaiipowerballot.com/)
<https://github.com/axelson/hawaii-power-ballot>  
A robust guide to _who_ and _what_ will be on the 2018 General Election ballot.

## [Surf News Network (Android App)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fujimoto.hsf)
An Android mobile application which allows you to gather surf reports in Hawaii
from Surf News Network and NOAA Surf Forecast in a clean and elegant manner so
you can spend less time loading web pages and more time at the beach.
