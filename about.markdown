Hello! My name is Aaron Fujimoto and I am:
```
- A Full Stack Software Engineer with an interest in UX
- A "Retired" Skimboarder
- An Egghead
- A Beer "snob"
- A fan of Music
- Interested in a lot of things
- Bad at a lot of things
```

Really what it comes down to is that I enjoy teaching and solving problems.
I hope this website will allow me to share some things I've learned and continue
to learn about.
