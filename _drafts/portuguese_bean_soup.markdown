Portuguese bean soup was one my favorite foods growing up. We've had a recipe
within the family that was continued to change and evolve from my grandma, to
my mother, and now to me. This is my recipe.

# Ingredients
- 2x - Redondo Brand Portuguese Sausage
- 1x - Hormel Salted Cured Pork
- 1x - Large Napa Cabbage
- 1x - Jumbo Yellow Onion
- 16oz Kidney Beans
- 16oz Tomato Soup?
- 16oz Beef Broth
- 1 Tsp Oregano
- 1 Tsp Cumin?
- 1 Tsp ?
- Some Potatoes
- Some Garlic?

# Steps
1. Cook the meats
2. Throw in everything else
3. Throw in more Cabbage!

## Cook the meats

## Just throw it all in

## Add Extra Cabbage and/or water
When there is space, keep adding cabbage. Cabbage is delicious, soaks up some
of the soup.

# Where's the macaroni?
I don't typically add macaroni into my soup but...

If you want to avoid Portuguese Bean Casserole, don't add in macaroni until the
very end, or only add in cooked macaroni to the warmed/hot soup. If you cook the
macaroni directly in the soup, it will continue to expand and absorb the water.
