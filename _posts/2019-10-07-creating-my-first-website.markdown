Once I had decided to make a website for myself, there were a few basic
questions that I had to solve to get up and running. What hosting would I use?
What technology stack should I choose? What DNS should I register with? In this
post I'll cover part of my thought process towards answering these questions.

There was no particular order or systematic approach towards creating a website
or solving these problems. I've designed, created, updated, and maintained a
handful of websites prior to becoming a Software Engineer so I didn't think much
of these things. In fact, it seemed pretty trivial to me to get this running.
However, the overall market was so much larger than it used to be. There are
way more options now than when I was working on websites. Therefore, answering
these questions did take some light research.
